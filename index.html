    First, we'll take a look at the spread of Covid-19 throughout 2021. Below, I have included two visualizations, the left
    shows the amount of cases in each county relative to population as time passes, while the right shows the amount of deaths
    in each county relative to population as time passes. This format will continue throughout all visualizations, with
    cases on the left and deaths on the right. As we can see, 2021 started really badly, with high numbers in both categories.
    However, as time passed, more people got vaccinated, and even with the rise of the Delta variant, we were able to keep case
    numbers down. However, as we get near the end of 2021, the case and death numbers get bad again, with most of the country
    turning dark in July, August, and September.

  Next, we have two interactive plots. Both represent data from the past month, and just as before, the visualization on
  the left shows cases while the one on the right shows deaths. If you mouse over counties, it will show you the county name
  and the cases per 100,000 for that county. In addition, you can use the legend on the right to isolate counties by category.
  The graph does not show us much more than the gif, but provides interesting county level data. We can check notable counties,
  such as Harris county which has had about 0.01 deaths per 100,000 over the last month, or Travis County which has had a little
  more than 5 cases per 100,000 over the last month.

  These two maps show similar information to the last one, but cases are aggregated by state instead of county and shown
  in a hex-grid. From this, we can see that the covid situation has been relatively bad in both Texas and the Midwest/West.
  This is shown in both the cases and deaths visualizations, with darker colors in the heavily-affected areas. Overall, the
  last few visualizations have shown that even though many people are vaccinated, and it seemed like we were doing well for
  a while, we still need to stay vigilant and be cautious of the ongoing pandemic, as will be exemplified in the following
  visuals.

  The next two graphs are the classic Covid-19 visualizations you always see, which just show cases and deaths over time.
  Additionally, if you hover over a date, it will show you the exact date, the amount of cases/deaths recorded on said day,
  and the 7-day running average of cases/deaths. The lines represent the 7-day running average, while the light grey bars
  represent the amount of cases/deaths on that day. These line graphs show us that the pandemic is not over, even if we
  may feel like it is, or want it to be. Numbers are still high, and even though the vaccines are really effective, there have
  still been a lot of cases and deaths.

  The button below will take you to another page, which hosts a very similar graph except it is separated by state, with a
  scroller to choose a state. I could not include it on this page because its file size is far too large. This graph just shows
  that no state has been able to entirely avoid the pandemic, and thus we all must be wary.

  Finally, we have two graphs that are less useful, but more fun. The first is a cartogram, a graph in which elements of a
  map are distorted based on the size of another factor. In this case, the other factor is the amount of cases per 100,000 in each state.
  Therefore, bigger states have more cases proportional to their population. The data is taken from the last month, and as we saw
  in the hex-grid before, the Midwest and Texas seem to have the largest states/darkest colors. The second graph is just a simple
  bar chart, which shows unchanged cases numbers for all states over the last month, and shows us that Michigan has had the most
  cases over the last month.
